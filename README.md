# Project Echo Sight

## Introduction:

 EchoSight is an innovative Android application designed to assist visually challenged individuals by providing audio descriptions of their surroundings upon request,Provide assistance with their surroundings,and various other features. EchoSight aims to enhance the independence and quality of life for visually impaired people. It is integrated with the Googles's Gemini model. Gemini acts as the hero of our project !.
 They do say, "A picture speaks more than a thousand words", But not being able to see a picture doesn't mean that we can't hear a thousand words isn't it?.

## Aim:

 We aim to provide more ease, comfort and independence to people who are visually impaired. We have unified various features under one application. Rather than providing Normal user interface (UI), Echosight provides very minimal User Interface but focuses on User Audio Interface (UAI). In Future, we aim to make this app accessible from every android phone, just like a normal assistant app basically for free of cost.

### We have also invented a pair of smart glasses which can be used with the echosight app, It has a built-in camera, which can be used to capture images. By wearing the glasses the user do not have to lift their phone, each time they have to use a feature which uses the camera, but point their head towards what they want to capture!. This will provide them more ease and comfort.
